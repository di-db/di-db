  	<h2>Who/What/Why</h2>
<p>Hey! This is a list of videos, webteases, and whatever that tell you how to fuck yourself with a dildo. Just select the tags you want and choose one of them. Enjoy!
</p> 

<p>
I am <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/MaxineTheFemboy">/u/MaxineTheFemboy</a> and when I am not hanging around reddit my hobby is to find sexual online resources. I've been collecting these links for years and I've decided to try and share with the outside world. This website exists for a few reasons. Mostly though no one else has done it yet, which annoyed me enough that I finally created this. Also, if you save as the main page, you will have a local backup which will protect you incase we lose a subreddit again. If you have any questions, thoughts, suggestions, feel free to message me or post in one of the subreddits I check I suppose.
</p>  
	<h2>This website is kind of crappy did you know</h2>
<p> Yeah I know, I have the coding ability of a cucumber, so highjacking some functions from an old project was really all I'm capable of. If you have the skills (or just ChatGPT), and the time, you are more than welcome to submit changes at the <a href="url">github repo</a>. If you want to get very involved I can probably add you to the repo though I will need to learn how first. This project is entirely open source! Download it, host it on your own repo, do whatever. This is the current todo list to be done eventually:
<ul> <li> Some sort of filtering by length </li>
<li> Some sort of filtering by search </li>
<li> Both positive and negative tagging </li>
<li> Custom ordering of the tags </li>
<li> An actual CSS theme </li>
<li> Hover over explanation of the tags </li>
<li> Get rid of the bugs </li>
<li> More type of tags for toys, positions, etc? </li>
<li> Intergrated user inputed videos, somehow? </li>
</ul>
</p>
  	<h2>I would like to help add to the database</h2>
<p>Oh incredible. Currently we are adding to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ufZTlnnwWUrNbzeVUgOw4OGYHsI5bIH8NC2KCyESjZY/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> though this will have to change eventually. The current ideas on how to improve, include backup links, maybe reviews or quality assurance. Better notes that aren't just me rambling. More complete tagging. etc. This will be discussed on probably the dildohero <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dildo_hero">subreddit</a> or maybe the discord.
